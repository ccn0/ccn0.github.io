                        Nexploration is a PC and Mobile survival exploration game where you play in a world
                        cursed by the higher powers to be forever darkened and smoggy. Explore the

                        and in preparation for the next game in the series. Keep an eye on my blog and this page for news
                        and updates for Nexploration and it's soon to come sequel. There is no defined date.

                    <h2>How to Play</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are several things on screen when you start a new game:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Status bar (box at the top left)</li>
                            <li>Map button (top right)</li>
                            <li>Scavenge button (eye button)</li>
                            <li>Item slot (bottom left)</li>
                            <li>And health, thirst, sanity meters</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Map</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you click the Map button, it'll open the Map screen. (WASD to move,
                        QE to zoom) You can click on undiscovered tiles to search them. Click
                        on discovered tiles to move to them. When you search an undiscovered
                        tile, you might get an item.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Scavenging</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clicking on the Eye button will scavenge your current location. You might
                        not get an item. You cannot scavenge the same location twice.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Items</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are many items that vary in value and utility. Examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Quenching and Food like Water Bottles, Milk, Crackers</li>
                            <li>Healing items like Health, Pills</li>
                            <li>Gizmoes like Thermometers, Watches, Calendars</li>
                        </ul>
                        These items can help you survive and other nice things. A Backpack allows
                        you to carry one more item. It'll appear sideways when empty. Click it when
                        you have an item in the main slot, and click it again to retrieve it and replace
                        what's currently in your item slot. Gizmoes allow you to see extra information
                        like the temperature, your max health, luck, what day it is, and more.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Vitals</h3>
                    <p>

                        You can see your current Health, Thirst, and Sanity. You can see more with gizmoes.
                        You die if you have 0 health or sanity. You can increase your health with food or
                        first aid items. Pills make you sane again. When your thirst reaches 0, you will lose
                        3 health every second. Make sure to keep all of these bars high.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you haven't played the game, run!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Luck</h3>
                    <p>
                        Luck is a useful tool in your arsenal. You start with zero, but by throwing
                        coins into wells and surviving challenging battles, you can increase this amount.
                        Luck is used to determine searching times, which items you find, and more.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Plague</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Plague event is summoned by tossing the red coin (Plague Coin) into a well.
                        You must survive for 100 seconds as everything around you gets infected. Once the
                        event is over, you get luckier, and the powers are more angry. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Werewolf</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Werewolf event is summoned by using the silver bullet at the Werewolf statue.
                        You must survive for 100 seconds whilst scaring off wolves. Once the event is over,
                        you get luckier, and the powers are angrier than before.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Blaze</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Blaze event occurs at 12:00 after you beat the Werewolf event. You must survive
                        for 50 seconds as you watch the world around you be burned. Once the event is over,
                        you're the luckiest as you can be, and the powers have sent otherworldly creatures to
                        hunt you. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Greedy</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Greedy event is summoned by placing a gem into the Greedy Alter (the giant blue stone).
                        You must survive for 2 minutes as you fight away Greedy's gems. After this, there is no more
                        battles. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>The End</h3>
                    <p>
                        After defeating Greedy, return to the center of the land. There is a spotlight. Scavenging will
                        reveal a battery. Use the battery at the spotlight. Watch the ending. Your game has been saved.
                        You can watch it again, but why would you do that?
