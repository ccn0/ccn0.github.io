        <h2 id="tutorial">How to play</h2>
        <p>
            There are several things on screen when you start the game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Status bar</li>
                <li>Map button</li>
                <li>Scavenge button (eye button)</li>
                <li>Item slot</li>
                <li>And health, thirst, sanity meters</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Map</h3><p>
            If you click the Map button, it'll open the Map screen. (WASD to move, QE to zoom)
            You can click on undiscovered tiles to search them. Click on discovered tiles to move to them.
            When you search an undiscovered tile, you might get an item.</p>
            <h3>Scavenge</h3><p>
            Clicking on the Eye button will scavenge your current location. You might not get an item.
            You cannot scavenge the same location twice.</p>
            <h3>Items</h3><p>
            There are many items in Nexploration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water bottles (Lesser, Normal, Greater)</li>
                <li>Food (Crackers)</li>
                <li>Gizmoes (Watch, Thermometer, Backpack)</li>
                <li>And other goodies (Coin, Sticks)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These items can help you survive and other nice things. 
                A Thermometer allows you to see your current heat.
                A Backpack allows you to carry one more item. It'll appear sideways when empty. Click it when
                you have an item in the main slot, and click it again to retrieve it.
                A watch shows the time.
                Water will quench your thirst, food will heal you.
                If you get your hand on a flask, go to a Well and click it to turn it into water.
            </p>
            <h3>Locations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Campfire:<br>
                    The campfire can be made using twigs on a non-campfire area.
                    This area provides heat, speeds up time, and is an all around nice spot to be in.
                </li>
                <li>Well:<br>
                    The well has some pretty neat features. 
                    It allows you to toss a coin into it (be careful which coins you use).
                    It can also be used to collect water.
                </li>
                <li>Ruined Towns:<br>
                    These towns were once filled with a thriving community, now dead thanks to the infinite dark.
                    You might find something interesting if you scavenge them.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1 id="spoilers">SPOILERS BELOW!</h1>
            <p>Please only read below if you have found a peculiar coin, finished the game, or are stuck.</p>
            <h2>Plague</h2>
            <p>
                The plague event is summoned by tossing the red coin (Plague Coin) into a well.
                You must survive for 100 seconds as everything around you gets infected.
                Once the event is done, you get luckier, and the powers are more angry.
            </p>
            <h2>Luck</h2>
            <p>
                Luck is a useful tool in your arsenal. You start with zero, but by throwing coins into wells
                and surviving challenging battles, you can increase this amount. Luck is used to determine
                searching times, which items you find, and more.
