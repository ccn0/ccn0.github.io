        <h2>What is Nexploration?</h2>
        <p>
            Nextploration is a PC/Mobile survival game where you play in a world cursed by the higher powers
            to be forever dark and smoggy. Explore the far reaches of the world and challenge the powers to fight you.
            You should watch your Health, Water, Sanity, and even Heat.

        <h2 id="tutorial">How to play</h2>
        <p>
            There are several things on screen when you start the game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Status bar</li>
                <li>Map button</li>
                <li>Scavenge button (eye button)</li>
                <li>Item slot</li>
                <li>And health, thirst, sanity meters</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Map</h3><p>
            If you click the Map button, it'll open the Map screen. (WASD to move, QE to zoom)
            You can click on undiscovered tiles to search them. Click on discovered tiles to move to them.
            When you search an undiscovered tile, you might get an item.</p>
            <h3>Scavenge</h3><p>
            Clicking on the Eye button will scavenge your current location. You might not get an item.
            You cannot scavenge the same location twice.</p>
            <h3>Items</h3><p>
            There are many items in Nexploration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water bottles (Lesser, Normal, Greater)</li>
                <li>Healing items (First Aid, Medicine)</li>
                <li>Food (Crackers, Milk, Chocolate Milk)</li>
                <li>Gizmoes (Watch, Thermometer, Backpack)</li>
                <li>And other goodies (Coin, Sticks)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These items can help you survive and other nice things. 
                A Thermometer allows you to see your current heat.<br>
                A Backpack allows you to carry one more item. It'll appear sideways when empty. Click it when
                you have an item in the main slot, and click it again to retrieve it.<br>
                A watch shows the time.<br>
                Water will quench your thirst, food will heal you.
                If you get your hand on a flask, go to a Well and click it to turn it into water.
            </p>
            <h3>Locations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Campfire:</b><br>
                    The campfire can be made using twigs on a non-campfire area.
                    This area provides heat, speeds up time, and is an all around nice spot to be in.
                </li>
                <li><b>Well:</b><br>
                    The well has some pretty neat features. 
                    It allows you to toss a coin into it (be careful which coins you use).
                    It can also be used to collect water.
                    You might find some silver too!
                </li>
                <li><b>Ruined Towns:</b><br>
                    These towns were once filled with a thriving community, now dead thanks to the infinite dark.
                    You might find something interesting if you scavenge them.
                </li>
                <li><b>Werewolf Statues:</b><br>
                    This is a statue of a werewolf. With 2 mysterious gems as the eyes, there seems to be an evil
                    precense inside of the statue. I wonder what happens if you use one of the werewolf's bane near it.
                </li>
                <li><b>Burnt:</b><br>
                    These areas of the world were set on fire during the Blaze event. They reveal previously
                    undiscovered things, so scavenge these areas a second time for more loot!
                </li>
                <li><b>Alters:</b><br>
                    This large rock contains a mysterious diamond shaped hole. It looks very un-natural. 
                    Maybe something might fit in the hole.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1 id="spoilers">SPOILERS BELOW!</h1>
            <p>Please only read below if you have found a peculiar coin, silver bullet, large gem, finished the game, or are stuck.</p>
            <h2>Plague</h2>
            <p>
                The Plague event is summoned by tossing the red coin (Plague Coin) into a well.
                You must survive for 100 seconds as everything around you gets infected.
                Once the event is over, you get luckier, and the powers are more angry.
            </p>
            <h2>Werewolf</h2>
            <p>
                The Werewolf event is summoned by using the silver bullet at the Werewolf statue.
                You must survive for 100 seconds whilst scaring off wolves.
                Once the event is over, you get luckier, and the powers are angrier than before.
            </p>
            <h2>Blaze</h2>
            <p>
                The Blaze event occurs at 12:00 after you beat the Werewolf event. 
                You must survive for 50 seconds as you watch the world around you be burned.
                Once the event is over, you're the luckiest as you can be, and the powers have sent 
                otherworldly creatures to hunt you.
            </p>
            <h2>Greedy</h2>
            <p>
                The Greedy event is summoned by placing a gem into the Greedy Alter (the giant blue stone). 
                You must survive for 2 minutes as you fight away Greedy's gems.
                After this, you have saved the world. The powers have given up, for now.
            </p>
            <h2>Luck</h2>
            <p>
                Luck is a useful tool in your arsenal. You start with zero, but by throwing coins into wells
                and surviving challenging battles, you can increase this amount. Luck is used to determine
                searching times, which items you find, and more.
