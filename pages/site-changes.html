  <h1>The Site Changes to CCN0</h1>

<div class="content">
<p>If you have ever looked at the source code to this site, you may have realized how messy it is. It is a hassle for me to look at and gives me fucking migraines. The fact that i didn't just host a style sheet on the GitHub page sooner. I tried doing it here, but I was lazy and only use the blog's special "wide card."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, you may be asking, 'What on the website is going to change?'<br>

Well first, the site will look much cleaner and I can add constant updates without it being a hassle to add minor things. Second, I can now add images or videos to CCN0. I was going to host some videos on STREAM but it was going nowhere and the CSS in the style attribute really slowed scrolling and working on the code. Now you can finally look at the code, see more updates, and more pages will have better design, looks, and functionality.</p><br><br>
