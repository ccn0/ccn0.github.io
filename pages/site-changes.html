<div class="content">
<p>If you have ever looked at the source code to this site, you may have realized how messy it is. It is a hassle for me to look at and gives me fucking migraines. The fact that i didn't just host a stylesheet on the github page sooner. I tryed doing it <a href="/stylesheet.css">here</a>, but I was lazy and only use the blog's special "wide card."<br><br>Now, you may be asking, <i>'What on the website is goig to change?'</i><br>Well first, the site will look much cleaner and I can add constant updates without it being a hassle to add minor things. Second, I can now add images or videos to CCN0. I was going to host some videos on <a href="stream">STREAM</a> but it was going nowhere and the CSS in the style attribute really slowed scrolling and working on the code. busy busy busy tbc</p><br><br>
