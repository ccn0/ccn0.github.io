        <p>Another year of CCN0? Crazy, I know. I thought I would&#39;ve given up on the internet, but many major things have happened! You might be surprised by what I&#39;m working on right now, and even more surprised how little I did with my projects I announced last year. Anyways, lets talk about the 5th year in CCN0!</p>
        <h2 id="domain-name">Domain Name??</h2>
        <p>That&#39;s right! the website has gone through a few changes, mainly its now located at <a href="https://ccn0.net">ccn0.net</a> and not a GitHub Pages domain! the blog was also moved to blog.ccn0.net. I&#39;ve also done some work on making my website and project more accessible and friendlier to use and view. My SEO has gotten a lot better over this last year, and many styles and changes are being made to make sure its fun to use this site and not just a pain in the ass.</p>
        <h2 id="things">Things??</h2>
        <p>Brand new things! CCN0TEPAD has a new sibling, Programmable Notepad, and a select menu that will be available later this week. Also, a search engine, and much more news!</p>
        <h3 id="searchpluspremium">SearchPlusPREMIUM????</h3>
        <p>That&#39;s right, ccn0 made a search engine! using the power of symbols, you can use any search engine, by just using one! check her out here, and follow the instructions for setting it as default. If you really want search suggestions, you can use the URL <code>https://duckduckgo.com/ac/?q=%s&amp;type=list</code> for the API, where %s is the query.</p>
        <h3 id="programmable-notepad">Programmable Notepad</h3>
        <p>Imagine a notepad you can write programs with, run commands, grab files from the web, and even save/load files! Programmable Notepad is a new version of <em>Notepad</em> that I&#39;ve been working on, ever since I dropped <em>Notepad</em> Win (which will keep being maintained) and its upgrades and features. It might come out later this year, but I&#39;m trying not to make promises! Also adding it to the things page as well very soon.</p>
        <h3 id="globalclocks">GlobalClocks?</h3>
        <p>Yes, GlobalClocks is being deprecated soon. I&#39;m working on a brand new clock thing, so stay tuned for that</p>
        <h3 id="soundlets-plus">Soundlets Plus!!</h3>
        <p>Soundlets Plus has had a bunch of updates recently, namely you don&#39;t need long long URLs and only need to host it somewhere its allowed to reach! just use the new URL parameters <code>?url=</code> to grab something from the web, and <code>?json=</code> if your stuck in the past.</p>
        <h2 id="april-fools">April Fools??</h2>
        <p>Here&#39;s a quote from past me:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>i am working on an april fools joke as of writing this, but i may have overestimated my capabilities, so this might be next years! sorry ai lovers...</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Unfortunately, my plans and development of this year&#39;s April Fools joke was <em>way</em> too ambitious, and time-consuming to work on. It may end up coming out for next year, but who knows for sure.</p>
        <h2 id="bluesky">Bluesky??</h2>
        <p>I have jump shipped from Mastodon, rest in peace. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ccn0.net">we are now on bluesky, @ccn0.net</a>! It was also one of the reasons I got ccn0.net in the first place. I think this platform will let me get more attention hopefully, I&#39;m still not sure if anyone is reading these.</p>
        <h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s next?</h2>
        <p>I am working on many new projects (and the ones from last year), things, and I&#39;m planning on being a little more active on social media as well.</p>
        <p>CCN0 and my other related projects will continue to grow in scope until I finally decide to give up the internet finally, but until then, I&#39;m still gonna be maintaining my website, and all of the things I&#39;ve made. Don&#39;t expect me to continuisly be active on the internet, I have taken several breaks (knowingly and unknowingly), but I wanna try to be more active anyways. Thanks for reading, and also being dumb enough to read all of this, again.</p>
        <p>P.S. the CCN0 website will receive a new look very soon...</p>
