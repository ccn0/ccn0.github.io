# the official CCN0 website

a github pages website where i do some wacky things. and yes, the homepage is a wasteland.

## highlights

- CCN0 Things `/things`
  - things i made that aren't good enough to be featured (still interesting though.)
- Soundlets Plus `/things/soundlets/plus`
  - create your own soundboard
- Games `/games/`
  - my games i made
- CCN0 Portal `/things/portal`
  - best kiosk hack homepage ever
 
## License???

assume i own everything unless stated otherwise. credits might be in the filename or on the page the file is used. or maybe i just hosted something from somewhere else, in which they probably did a better job at using a license and crediting people.
