## Licenses???

assume i own everything (all rights reserved) unless stated otherwise. credits might be in the filename, scripts, or on the page the file is used. or maybe i just hosted something from somewhere else, in which they probably did a better job at using a license and crediting people. just look real hard and youll find it. the github page itself is all rights reserved, unless i say so.
