            <li>
                <p>Hover is a game where you hover your mouse or touch and hold a circle
                that disappears, shape shifts, divides, brightens and darkens, and
                resizes for a certain amount of time to get a prize. Originally, you could sell
                yourself on Stocks if you qualified, you had to have 5000 or more to qualify, to
                get more prize points. if you did sign up, you had to give some of your money
                back to your investors and they would give more back. it was removed because no
                one played it. Also, there was a radio where you can listen to 5 different radio
                stations, QOG Radio Station, the Northern Radio, Laughable, and two others.
                Laughable was notable because it featured very distorted laughing and had morse code
                that said "IM COMING FOR YOU QOGMAN" and had random whistling at parts. The radio
                was later removed</p>
