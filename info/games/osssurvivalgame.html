            <li>
                <p>The OSS Survival Game is a game where you survive from people
                and viruses whilst trying to survive on water and energy bars.
                The game was intended to be the Michael Jackson's: Musical Stars
                game but was retextured to be an OSS game. The re-texture was done
                to avoid getting NFE'd or banned on Scratchdue to blood, medicine,
                death, and more. You would collect tin cans, cardboard 
                boxes, trash bags, duffle bags, and cups to get 1 random item from a list.
                You could only hold 1 item, so when you grab one of the bags, you drop
                the item in the item box. You have 4 stats to keepin control, HEALTH,
                THIRST, ANGER, and RICHES, make sure to keep HEALTH over 15, THIRST
                over 0, ANGER under 50,and RICHES under 100. When you get too angry
                or thirsty, your health will deplete by the second. When you were too
                rich, people will try to rob you of your items and riches. When health
                gets too low, your vision is obstructed by "kool-aid".</p>
