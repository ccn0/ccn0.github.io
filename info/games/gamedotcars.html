            <li>
                <p>game.cars is a game where you try to avoid and eliminate a red dot.
                you can use bullets to stun it, and build green lines to avoid its bullets.
                it can also build yellow lines to avoid your bullets.
                there are 6 kinds of power ups, green to get 1 to 5 ammo,
                purple to get 5 to 20 ammo, orange turns your line green
                for 20 seconds and gives you 5 ammo, light blue removes 5
                to your 100 of the red dots health and gives you 5 ammo,
                yellow stops the red dot from hiding its line and dot and
                removes your ammo times 2 of red dots health, dark blue
                teleports red dot away from you. it was based of tron and was initially
                a test to make a line-scanner, 'bliner', but became a game.</p>
