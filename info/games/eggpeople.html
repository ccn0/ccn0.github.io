            <li>
                <p>Egg People was a The Sims-like game where you build a house and talk to people and
                control the world. the game had the most graphic design done for it and was gonna
                have a theme and stuff. it was going to be the 'real' version of <a href="/info/plsadopt">plsadopt.gold</a>
                the game was scrapped due to bugs and lack of interest.
                you can download the <a href="/dumbegggame.sb3">.sb3 file</a>for free.</p>
