## About

game.cars is a game where you try to avoid and eliminate a red dot.  
You can use bullets to stun it, and build green lines to avoid its bullets.  
It can also build yellow lines to avoid your bullets.  
There are 6 kinds of power-ups:  
- Green: get 1 to 5 ammo  
- Purple: get 5 to 20 ammo  
- Orange: turns your line green for 20 seconds and gives you 5 ammo  
- Light Blue: removes 5 from the red dot's 100 health and gives 5 ammo  
- Yellow: stops the red dot from hiding its line and dot, and removes double your ammo from red dot's health  
- Dark Blue: teleports red dot away from you  

It was based on Tron and was initially a test to make a line-scanner, "bliner", but became a game.
