                <p>
                    Soundlets+ is a soundboard maker that allows you to play sounds from external sources or
                    locally on your computer. It was made as the final successor to Funny Hahas, Wikinoise, and Soundlets.
                    It also features the ability to import/export soundboards and even share soundboards as a link.
                    You can also drag soundlets into your bookmark bar as bookmarklets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soundlets (without the plus) was a bookmarklet creator that allowed you to enter a URL to a sound and
                    then drag the javascript link into your bookmark bar. It was succeeded by Soundlets+.

            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Enter a sounds file (.mp3, .wav, .aac, etc) into the Sound URL box.
                    Give it a name and/or speed. Then Add Sound.<br>
                    You can also add dividers (|) and line breaks to help sort sounds.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can drag soundlets into your bookmark bar to use them anywhere.
                    You can also export the soundboard as a JSON file and save it to your computer,
                    and load soundboards using the Load JSON button. You can also share soundboards
                    through a link by clicking the Copy Link to Soundboard button. Just know the URL
                    could be very long depending on the size, names, and lengths of URLs in your soundboard.
                </p>
