hey! pls dont expect any of this to come out in the end,
as programmable notepad is still in very early beta.
any changes will probably be massive and anything made
within the notepad may be unstable.

do not trust random programs you find on the internet,
and dont use eval for any other purposes but your own.

i am not liable for any problems faced with programmable notepad.
