    <p class="question" id="permalink">How do I get a permalink for a blog post?</p>
    <p class="answer">Take the URL for the blog page (https://ccn0.github.io/things/blog) 
        and add a hashtag (#), then type the date of the post in a format like (m10d2y2022) 
        and add a n0 at the end. Why n0? Because there might be multiple posts from 1 parent. 
        Resulting URL should look something like (https://ccn0.github.io/things/blog#m9d6y2022n0) 
        and this should work. If it does not, 
        please <a href="mailto:ccn0ask@mail.com?subject=FUCKED UP PERMALINK">email me</a>.</p>
