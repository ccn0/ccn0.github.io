            <p>the final version of Funny Hahas is here! you can now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">drag and drop</a> sounds into your bookmark bar to play them anywhere. sounds can also be played infinitely instead of waiting for the sound to be over. you can no longer request sounds, as we are no longer adding sounds to the soundboard. have fun with the ashes, <br>farewell Funny Hahas, made 11/15/2021 - 9/12/2022</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post fh" title="about Funny Hahas (9/6/22)">
            <p>sound board is now deprecated. new idea: bookmarklets for the sounds so you can play on any site (except for sites like blooket who hate external scripts). might come soon, we'll see.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post fh" title="about Funny Hahas (old af)">
            <p>drop 5 will only have YOUR suggestions and requests. make a sound request <a href="https://forms.gle/WCmkevyPH6YuGs9u8">here</a></p>
