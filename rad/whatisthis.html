    <h1>What is rAdBOX?</h1>
    This is an advertisement to another one of my (CCN0) projects. 
    <br>
    Many people use my site (<a href="https://ccn0.github.io/" target="_top">CCN0.github.io</a>), and might not be aware of other projects I am working on.
    They may even be on a discontinued page and not realize since this site has no maps, rhyme or reason.<br>
    <br>
    My solution to this problem was rAdBOX.
    It is my way of marketing other projects, updated projects, and better projects to people easier.<br>
    <br>
    If you ever see my logo randomly on a page, either your <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo" target="_top">adblocker</a> has worked, or the rAd failed to load.
    These ads get blocked by ad blockers anyways. It doesn't matter, just get one.<br>
    <br>
    <b>NONE OF THESE ARE PAID PROMOTIONS, ONLY THINGS THAT ARE ADVERTISED SHOULD BE PROJECTS OUTSIDE OF CCN0, ARRY, AWFULEARTH, OR QOGLAND.</b>
