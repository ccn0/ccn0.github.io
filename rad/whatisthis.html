    <h1>What is rAdBOX?</h1>
    This is an advertisement to another one of my projects. 
    Many people use this site, and might not be aware of other projects I am working on.
    They may even be on a discontinued page and not realize since this site has no maps.<br>
    <br>
    My solution to this problem was rAdBOX.
    It is my way of marketing other projects and better projects to people easier.<br>
    <br>
    If you ever see my logo randomly on a page, it is either a bug or your adblocker has worked.
    I don't know why it tiles wrong either.
